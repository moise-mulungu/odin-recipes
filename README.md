The RECIPES PROJECT consists of creating a main webpage from there three other recipe webpages are linked. I created a main webpage called index.html on which are the following recipe webpages: spicy-hot-chicken-legs.html on which i describe how to coook this tasty and delicious recipe made of drumsticks seasoned by onion, garlic and served with butter and cheese, then breakfast-biscuits.html on which i demonstrate how you can make a quick and easy breakfast made of eggs, bacon and biscuits and finally on the last webpage mushroom-barley-soup.html teaches how to make a soup from mushrooms, onions, garlic, olive oil which is good for digestion.
